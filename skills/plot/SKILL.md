description: Render a 2D heatmap, filled-contour map, 1D time series, xy scatter, wind-rose, u/v quiver, or layered map PNG from weather-skills standard dataset Zarrs. Side-by-side maps on different grids (CHIRPS 0.05° next to ECMWF 1.5°) are one repeated -i per file: each file is its own heatmap panel on its own lat/lon. Do not coarsen them onto one grid. --layer stacks inputs on a single map and does not make a panel per dataset. Name files with repeatable -i, --x/--y, or repeatable --layer KIND:PATH. Set every other parameter in --spec. For precipitation, run aggregate-temporal then convert-to-totals first. For a lead-week verification grid, use plot-verify.

# plot

Name the files on the command line. Put every drawing choice in `--spec`.

Kind, variable, titles, colormap, map window, panel layout, index, reduce, and font size are spec keys: `traces[0].kind`, `inputs[0].variable`, `title`, `theme.colormap`, `geo.bbox`, `layout.facet.rows` / `columns`, `inputs[0].index`, `traces[0].reduce`, `theme.fontsize`. `--layer` is `KIND:PATH` only; options for that layer go on the matching `layers[]` entry. A `patch` key inside the JSON is rejected.

## Before guessing a flag or a key

There is no `--rows`, `--title`, `--fontsize`, `--cbar-label`, `--patch`, or any other per-knob flag — only the ones in **Command line** below. Every drawing choice is a JSON key under `--spec`, and an unknown or misplaced key is a hard error listing every valid key at that level (never a silent no-op). If you don't already know the shape of `--spec`, do **not** discover it by submitting guesses one at a time:

1. Run `--dump-spec -` with just `-i <one of your files>` and no `--spec` at all. It prints the complete, already-resolved default spec — every top-level section (`inputs`, `traces`, `layout`, `theme`, `geo`, `axes`, `annotations`, ...) with its real keys, so you can see the whole schema in one call instead of one rejected key at a time.
2. For the full key reference in prose, read the **Spec keys** table below, or [`docs/plotting.md`](../../docs/plotting.md).
3. Write one `--spec`, render once, and look at the resulting PNG (or run `inspect-figure` on it) before trying another variation. The `plot hash` printed after a render tells you only that the image changed, not what changed or how it looks — never use hash comparisons to choose between layout options (a title's position, panel spacing, colorbar placement). Look at the pixels.

## Side by side, or one map

| Goal | How |
| --- | --- |
| Two datasets in one PNG, each on its own lat/lon (0.05° beside 1.5°) | Pass `-i` once per file. Put a `subplots` entry on each cell. `row` and `col` are 1-based. `layers` on that cell stack. The cell's `title`, `vmin`, `vmax`, `colormap`, `cbar_label`, and `colorbar` style that cell; a key on the layer wins. |
| Those same datasets drawn on top of each other | `--layer`. One axes. This does not make a panel per dataset. `layers[].panel` is not a key. |
| Several times or forecast steps of one dataset | One heatmap trace. `layout.facet.rows` and `columns` tile those slices. |

Different spacing is expected. Do not `coarsen` or `downscale` just to draw the figure. A shared lat/lon grid is only for `difference` and `verify`, which subtract cell by cell.

Each side-by-side trace has to already be one map. A `time` or `step` longer than one value is an error — aggregate it first (`aggregate-temporal`, then `convert-to-totals` for precipitation).

## Panel spacing on map grids

Every figure — map or chart, one panel or many — is laid out by matplotlib's constrained-layout engine, which redraws its margins from the actual rendered content every time. It automatically reserves room for panel titles, the figure title, and colorbars, including a row whose title happens to wrap onto two lines while its neighbors don't. You do **not** need to set `layout.facet.wspace` / `hspace` or `layout.suptitle.y` for a normal multi-row or multi-column map grid — that used to be required (Cartopy axes broke the old `tight_layout`-based sizing pass), it no longer is.

`layout.facet.wspace` / `hspace` still exist as optional fine-tuning — set them if you want more breathing room than the automatic layout gives you, not to fix crushed or overlapping panels:

```bash
--spec '{"layout":{"facet":{"rows":2,"columns":4,"wspace":0.15,"hspace":0.35}}}'
```

A figure `title` that is wider than the figure itself wraps onto more lines automatically — a centered figure title does not grow the canvas to fit itself, so without wrapping it would get cut off at the left and right edges instead. Panel titles already wrapped the same way; nothing to set for either case.

## Figure-wide vs per-panel settings

One rule covers every knob that can vary panel by panel: a figure-level setting is the default that applies to **every** panel; a panel-specific key narrows or overrides it for just that panel.

| Setting | Figure-wide default | Per-panel override |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Color scale, colormap, colorbar label | `vmin` / `vmax` / `theme.colormap` / `cbar_label` (or `inputs[].*`) | `subplots[].vmin` / `.vmax` / `.colormap` / `.cbar_label` |
| Colorbar styling (ticks, labels, size, …) | `layout.colorbar` | `subplots[].colorbar` — same keys, deep-merged onto the figure default for that cell's own colorbar only |
| Titles | `layout.facet.titles` / `traces[].title` / top-level `subplot_titles` | `subplots[].title` |
| Annotations and shapes | An `annotations[]` / `shapes[]` entry with no `panel` | Set `panel` on that entry to an int (one panel) or a list of ints (a subset) |

**Breaking change:** an `annotations[]` / `shapes[]` entry with no `panel` (or `axes`) used to draw on panel 0 only. It now draws on **every panel**. If an existing spec relied on the old default targeting just the first panel, add `"panel": 0` explicitly.

`subplots[].colorbar` only works when that cell's colorbar isn't shared with another cell's (i.e. the cells have distinct `vmin`/`vmax`/`colormap`, or `layout.shared_colorscale` isn't `true`) — one physical colorbar can't have two different styles, so a conflicting override is a hard error naming the cells involved.

## Command line

```
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/plot.py -i <in.zarr> -o <out.png> \
    --spec '{"inputs":[{"variable":"tp"}],"traces":[{"kind":"heatmap"}],"title":"Week 1"}'

uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/plot.py -o <out.png> \
    --layer heatmap:<a.zarr> --layer scatter:<b.zarr> \
    --spec '{"title":"IMERG vs TAHMO","layers":[{"id":"a","variable":"precip"},{"id":"b","variable":"precip"}]}'

uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/plot.py --x <x.zarr> --y <y.zarr> -o <out.png> \
    --spec '{"traces":[{"kind":"xy","pair_on":"year"}]}'

uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/plot.py -i <in.zarr> --dump-spec -
```

- `-i`, `--input` — repeatable Zarr. One file is one heatmap, contour, or quiver panel. `timeseries` and `windrose` take a single `-i`. Mutually exclusive with `--layer` and with `--x` / `--y`. Optional when `--spec` already lists paths and no dataset flag was passed.
- `--x` / `--y` — the two Zarrs for `traces[0].kind` `xy`.
- `--layer` — repeatable `KIND:PATH` only (`heatmap`, `scatter`, `quiver`, `outline`, `mask`). Layer ids are `a`, `b`, `c`, … in this order. Options go on `layers[]` in `--spec`, matched by that id.
- `-o`, `--output` — PNG path. Required unless `--dump-spec` is set.
- `--spec` — JSON object or path. Deep-merged onto the spec built from the files you named. Your values win. `inputs[]` merges by `id`, `traces[]` by `input` (else `id`), `layers[]` by `id` (else index). An empty list does not wipe the figure.
- `--dump-spec` — write the merged spec as JSON and skip the PNG. Bare `--dump-spec` or `-` prints to stdout; a path writes a file. Run it with just `-i` and no `--spec` to see the complete default schema before writing one — that is the fastest way to learn what keys exist, faster than guessing a flag and reading the rejection. The full JSON is token-expensive once your `--spec` is large; at that point use it to check one key, then edit `--spec` and draw again.
- `--theme-file` — palette file (JSON or TOML). Not a spec key. Named colormaps resolve against this file, then `~/.config/weather-skills/plot.toml`.

Unset `traces[0].kind` stays `heatmap`. Unset `theme.fontsize` stays 16.

## Kinds

Set `traces[0].kind` in `--spec`.

- `heatmap` — lon/lat `pcolormesh` with coastlines, country borders, filled lakes, and (on country-scale views) admin-1 boundaries. One `-i` is one panel per `step` or `time`. Each extra `-i` adds a panel on that file's own lat/lon; see **Side by side, or one map**. Shared color scale, colorbar on the right for one panel and on the bottom for several. A single file's panel titles are calendar dates (`14 Sept '26`) or inclusive ranges (`4–10 Aug '26`); forecast leads keep `<start> until <end>`. Several files use `subplot_titles`, then `inputs[].label`, then the file name. The colorbar label is the variable and units (`Total precipitation [mm]`), not the date. Default grid is up to 4 columns. Set `layout.facet.rows` and `layout.facet.columns` to override; leftover cells stay blank. Panel spacing (including room for titles between rows) is automatic — see **Panel spacing on map grids** below. Ensemble `number` is averaged. `inputs[0].index` overrides the reduction for any other extra dim. Precipitation totals use a nested absolute-mm palette (same color = same millimetres; the window follows `aggregation_period`). For rainfall anomalies, omit `theme.colormap` so the diverging millimetre classes apply. A single-input heatmap and `--layer heatmap:<path>` draw the same picture.
- `contour` — the same map as `heatmap`, drawn with `contourf` and thin black isolines. Values are interpolated between grid points. Cannot be combined with `--layer`.
- `timeseries` — one line plus a marker at each time. Leftover non-time dims are not averaged: set `traces[0].reduce` to a list of dim names, or `traces[0].along` to draw one line per value of that dim. A forecast (`step` plus a scalar init `time`) is plotted against valid time (`init + step`). An analysis or obs cube is plotted against its `time` axis. For several series as stacked panels, use `plot-timeseries`.
- `xy` — scatter one 1D series against another. Pass `--x` and `--y`, or one `-i` with `traces[0].x_variable` and `traces[0].y_variable`. Each series is reduced like `timeseries` (`geo.bbox` / `geo.mask_geojson` subset first when lat/lon remain). `traces[0].pair_on` is `time` (default, inner-join on time or valid time), `year` (calendar year), or `index` (position; lengths must match). Duplicate keys are an error — aggregate or select first. Points are labeled when `pair_on` is `year`, or when it is `time` and there are 25 points or fewer. This is not `--layer scatter`, which draws stations on a map.
- `windrose` — one polar rose of meteorological-from direction (0° = N, 90° = E, clockwise), stacked by speed. Converts eastward `u` and northward `v`. Auto-detects `u10`/`v10` and CF `eastward_wind` / `northward_wind`, or set `traces[0].u_variable` and `traces[0].v_variable`. Remaining space, time, and ensemble dims become samples; the ensemble is not averaged. `geo.bbox`, `geo.mask_geojson`, and `inputs[0].index` subset samples first. 16 sectors; speed classes 0–2, 2–4, …, ≥12 m/s, with empty high bins dropped. `theme.colormap` colors the stacks (default blue→orange).
- `quiver` — wind-speed `pcolormesh` (default `YlGn`) with `u`/`v` arrows on the native grid. Arrow length is auto-scaled so a typical wind is about 1.5× the subsampled spacing. Set `traces[0].quiver.step` to stride and `traces[0].quiver.scale` to override arrow length. A `--layer quiver:` entry uses the same keys on `layers[].quiver`. Same panels and geo overlays as `heatmap`. Ensemble `number` is averaged. Finer grids auto-thin to about 1.5° unless `quiver.step` is set. Colorbar is `Wind speed [m/s]` (or `Wind speed anomaly` when the u field name says so), with arrow keys at 5 and 10 m/s. With `--layer`, use `--layer quiver:PATH` instead of kind `quiver`.

## Layers

`--layer` draws several inputs on the **same** axes. It is not the side-by-side layout above. There is no per-layer panel: `layers[].panel` is not a key.

`heatmap`, `scatter` (`station_id` / `point_id`), and `quiver` read Zarrs. `outline` draws GeoJSON edges. `mask` is a GeoJSON NaN mask, the same idea as `geo.mask_geojson`. A layer inherits `inputs[].variable`, `theme.colormap`, `inputs[].index`, `vmin`, and `vmax` when its own `layers[]` entry omits them. A forecast `step` axis still panels one map per lead; a static layer (outline, cities, a single-time field) repeats on every panel. Another data layer on the same axis kind is intersected on labels. Overlaying calendar `time` on a raw `step` forecast is an error — run `step-to-time` first. Same-variable heatmap and scatter layers stacked with `--layer` share one color scale unless `layout.shared_colorscale` is `false`. Side-by-side traces and `subplots[]` cells each scale independently by default, even with the same variable — set `layout.shared_colorscale: true` to share one colorbar across all of them.

`--layer` cannot be combined with kind `timeseries`, `xy`, `windrose`, or `contour`.

## When to use

- CHIRPS next to a forecast, each at its own resolution, in one PNG. Two heatmap traces. Do not coarsen the forecast onto the obs grid for this.
- Stations or a GeoJSON outline on a forecast or obs heatmap. Use `--layer` for that overlay.
- A quick-look map or a time/step profile.
- One index against another (IOD vs rainfall, or two variables in one Zarr).
- A wind rose or an S2S-style wind-vector map from u/v.
- Precipitation only after `aggregate-temporal` and `convert-to-totals`. Fetchers write rates; the figure should show period totals (`mm`). For rainfall anomalies, omit `theme.colormap`.

Do not `coarsen` datasets onto one grid just to draw them. A shared lat/lon grid is for `difference` and `verify`. For one obs week versus week-4 through week-1 forecasts with a hits row, use `plot-verify`. For rainy-season onset dates from `indicator --detect first`, use `plot` and do not average `number` first.

## Output

A PNG at `--output`. Stdout prints a pixel `plot hash` (sha256 of RGB pixels) and `data: not null (<var> N/M finite)` or `data: NULL`. `NULL` means every plotted variable is all-NaN — run `inspect-zarr` on the input. A changed hash only proves the pixels differ, not what changed or whether it looks right (a title moved above vs. inside a panel hashes just as differently as a broken render) — comparing hashes across a few candidate specs is never a substitute for looking at the PNG. Always look at the PNG, or run `inspect-figure` on it. `--dump-spec` skips the PNG and this report.

The colorbar and timeseries y-axis label come from variable attrs: `long_name`, then `GRIB_name`, then the variable name, then `"value"`, with `[units]` when present. Dates stay on panel titles. Display units are short (`mm/day`, `°C`, `mm`, `m/s`). A wind rose labels speed stacks in those units and the radial axis as frequency percent. Prefer an amount Zarr from `convert-to-totals` (`Total precipitation [mm]`). A precip rate that already has `aggregation_period` is converted to a period total for the figure only. Unaggregated fetch rates stay `mm day-1`.

Provenance is one `weather_skills_history` JSON array in the PNG metadata:

```bash
python3 -c "from PIL import Image; import json; print(json.loads(Image.open('out.png').info['weather_skills_history']))"
```

## Spec keys

Values are JSON. Unknown keys on artist or axes objects are errors. There is no `eval` and no Python callable.

| What you want | `--spec` path |
| --- | --- |
| Kind | `traces[0].kind` |
| Variable | `inputs[0].variable` (or `layers[].variable`) |
| Titles and axis text | `title`, `subplot_titles`, `xlabel`, `ylabel`, `cbar_label`, `legend`. `layout.facet.titles` and `traces[].title` are panel titles and are stored on `subplot_titles`. |
| Color limits | Figure `vmin`, `vmax` for every panel. One panel: `inputs[].vmin`, `inputs[].vmax`, `inputs[].colormap`, `inputs[].cbar_label`. `traces[].kind` and `traces[].mesh` / `contour` / `quiver` stay on that trace. |
| Colormap and font | `theme.colormap`, `theme.fontsize`, `theme.template` (`weather_skills` or `colorblind`), `theme.rc` |
| Map window | `geo.bbox` as `[N, W, S, E]`, `geo.extent`, `geo.mask_geojson`, `geo.cities`, `geo.draw_boxes` |
| Panels | `layout.figsize` as `[W, H]`, `layout.dpi`, `layout.facecolor`, `layout.facet.rows` / `columns` / `wspace` / `hspace`. One heatmap trace: rows and columns tile `time` or `step`. Several heatmap traces: one panel per trace. `wspace` / `hspace` are optional fine-tuning, not required (see **Panel spacing on map grids**). |
| Shared color scale | `layout.shared_colorscale` (`false` = never auto-share, even stacked `--layer` entries; `true` = one colorbar across every panel/cell), plus figure-level `vmin` / `vmax`. Unset: `--layer` stacks auto-share same-variable layers; side-by-side traces and `subplots[]` cells scale independently |
| Extra-dim reduction | `inputs[0].index`, `traces[0].reduce`, `traces[0].along` |
| xy / wind | `traces[0].pair_on`, `x_variable`, `y_variable`, `u_variable`, `v_variable`, `quiver.step`, `quiver.scale` |
| One layer's options | `layers[]` entry with that layer's `id` |

`theme.rc` applies after the seaborn theme, so it wins. Backend and interactive keys (`backend`, `interactive`, `tk.*`, …) are rejected. Do not invent `theme.subplot_title_fontsize` or `theme.label_fontsize`. `theme.fontsize` fills the seven size keys below; `--dump-spec` includes the resolved values.

| `theme.rc` key | What it changes |
| --- | --- |
| `axes.titlesize` | map panel titles |
| `figure.titlesize` | figure title |
| `axes.labelsize` | x/y labels and the colorbar label. Colorbar-only size is `layout.colorbar.labelsize` |
| `xtick.labelsize` / `ytick.labelsize` | tick labels |
| `legend.fontsize` / `legend.title_fontsize` | legend text |
| `font.size` | fallback when a more specific key is unset |
| `font.family` / `font.weight` | typeface and default weight |
| `axes.titleweight` / `figure.titleweight` | panel / figure title weight |
| `axes.titlepad` / `axes.labelpad` | gap from a panel title or every axis label to the axes. Colorbar-only pad is `layout.colorbar.labelpad`. Figure-title height is `layout.suptitle.y` |
| `xtick.major.pad` / `ytick.major.pad` | gap from tick labels to the spines |
| `axes.labelweight` | axis-label weight |
| `lines.linewidth` | default line width. One series belongs on `traces[].line.linewidth` |
| `axes.linewidth` | spine thickness |

Use `layout.dpi`, `layout.figsize`, and `layout.facecolor`, not `figure.dpi`, `figure.figsize`, or `figure.facecolor`.

| Spec key | Matplotlib surface |
| --- | --- |
| `axes` | Applied after the data are drawn: scales, limits, labels, ticks (`xticks` / `yticks` as lists or `{values, labels}`), locators, formatters, spines, grid, legend, twins. `xlabel` / `ylabel` may be a string or `{text, loc, pad, coords, rotation, ha, va, …}` (`coords` is `[x, y]` in axes fraction; omit `text` to keep the drawn label). A dump includes only the keys you set. |
| `annotations` | `ax.text` or `ax.annotate`. `xref: paper` / `transform: axes` uses axes fraction. No `axes` / `panel` draws on every panel (**breaking change** — previously panel 0 only); `panel` as an int or a list of ints narrows to that panel or subset. |
| `shapes` | `rect`, `hline`, `vline`, `hspan`, `vspan`, `line`, `circle` / `ellipse`. Same `panel` broadcast/narrow rule as `annotations`. |
| `traces[].line` / `.mesh` / `.contour` / `.scatter` / `.bar` / `.quiver` / `.windrose` | kwargs for that artist. `contour.lines: false` skips the isoline overlay |
| `traces[].fill` | `fill_between` for a band set on `traces[0].band` |
| `traces[].mediogram` | `{width, forecast, mclimate, mean, legend}` |
| `layout.facet.wspace` / `hspace` | gap between panels, as a fraction of panel size |
| `layout.colorbar` | see below. Unknown keys error |

| `layout.colorbar` key | What it changes |
| --- | --- |
| `labelpad` | points between colorbar ticks and the colorbar label |
| `labelsize` | colorbar label font size |
| `ticksize` | colorbar tick-label font size |
| `pad` | gap between the map axes and the colorbar strip |
| `len` / `shrink` | colorbar length as a fraction of the axes |
| `thickness` | thickness in points (`> 1`) or a fraction (`≤ 1`) |
| `location` / `orientation` | `right`, `bottom`, … |
| `extend` / `extendfrac` / `extendrect` | arrows past the ends of the scale |
| `ticks` / `labels` | tick positions and text (same count) |
| `drawedges` / `spacing` / `format` | class edges, uniform or proportional spacing, tick format |

A timeseries series can use a twin y-axis with `"twin": "y"`. Reposition a wind-rose frequency label with `--spec '{"axes": {"ylabel": {"coords": [1.15, 0.5], "rotation": 0}}}'`. The full key table is in [`docs/plotting.md`](../../docs/plotting.md).
