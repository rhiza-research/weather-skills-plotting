# plot

Draws a figure from a Jsonnet spec. The spec evaluates to a standard [Plotly figure](https://plotly.com/python/reference/) (`data`, `layout`, `frames`). Wherever Plotly expects data, write a string that starts with `@` and names it: `'@OBS.precip.isel(time=0)'`. Name every input on the command line.

## Data comes from the inputs, never from you

Every value the figure shows as data comes from an input through an `@` reference: grid values, station readings, scores, counts, means, table cells, bar heights, colours on a scale, numbers printed on cells or points. Never type data into the spec, whether you read it from a file, computed it, copied it from another tool's output or remember it. That holds even where the lint would let it through (a few points in a scatter, `text`, annotations). The figure records the inputs that made it and is stamped as traceable; typed-in data makes that record false.

Typed in by hand, only:
- words: titles, axis titles, legend names, category and tick labels, units, notes, sources;
- the positions of marks placed by hand: a town pin, a line at a date or a border, a threshold (better as `--const NAME=VALUE`, so it is recorded).

To print a value on a cell or point, bind the data and format it with `texttemplate` (`'%{z:.1f}%'`); never write the number into `text`. If the values you need are not in a Zarr yet, make one with the skills (verify, aggregate, concat, …) and bind it. If no skill can make them, say so rather than draw them.

## How a figure is made: spec → render → lint → bind → export

1. **Spec.** You write Jsonnet: Plotly keys for everything drawn, and an `@` reference wherever data goes (`x: '@OBS.lon'`, `z: '@OBS.precip.isel(time=0)'`). Each input is named with `-i FILE=NAME`; `std.extVar('inputs')` describes them (dims, variables, dates, bbox) for loops and titles.
2. **Render.** plot evaluates the Jsonnet into plain Plotly JSON, references still unbound. `--dump-spec -` prints this.
3. **Lint.** Before any data is read, the JSON is checked against Plotly's schema: every key that can put data on the chart must hold an `@` reference, never typed-in values. That covers data keys (`x`, `y`, `z`, `lat`, `customdata`, `values`, …), per-point lists in keys like `marker.color`, `marker.size` and `text` (one value there is styling), keys that generate a value for every point (`x0` / `dx`, `base`, error-bar `value`), the coordinates of images on a data axis (`xref: 'x'`), menu and slider `args`, frames and templates. Keys Plotly doesn't define are refused, since they can't be checked. Every problem is listed at once. Shapes and annotations are marks placed by hand, so their positions may be typed in (`x0: 36`, `x: '2026-10-31'`), or passed as `--const NAME=VALUE` and written `'@const.NAME'` when they should be recorded or change from run to run.
4. **Bind.** Each reference is resolved from its input: it selects, reshapes or labels stored values, or scales a marker's size in pixels (see `@` references below), and its shape is checked against the key.
5. **Export.** Plotly validates the figure, and it is written to each `-o` with its QA lines (see Output).

## Usage

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/plot.py -i rain_week.zarr=OBS -i kitui.geojson=REGION \
  --spec map.jsonnet -o map.png
```

Start from a recipe. `--recipe` lists them, `--recipe NAME` prints one to copy and edit, and `--spec NAME` runs one as is (its `// plot.py …` comment line is the command; the files are in `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/recipes/`).

| Recipe | Draws |
| --- | --- |
| `map.jsonnet` | One map: a grid on a stepped palette, the base map, and a county or polygon outlined from GeoJSON |
| `stations.jsonnet` | Station dots over a grid on one colorbar, labelled with their ids |
| `panels.jsonnet` | One map per forecast step in a grid, one colorbar, panel titles |
| `members.jsonnet` | Ensemble members in grey and the mean in bold, at the cell nearest a point |
| `band.jsonnet` | A shaded 10–90% band between two quantile lines, with observations |
| `sd_band.jsonnet` | Mean ± 1 SD as a shaded band (stacked fills), with the mean as a line |
| `seasons.jsonnet` | Past years and a forecast plume on one day-of-year axis |
| `wind_markers.jsonnet` | Wind arrows as Plotly markers sized in pixels by speed (`@…speed * k`), with no extra data step |
| `animation.jsonnet` | A map played through time: HTML with play / slider, or a looping GIF |
| `cross_section.jsonnet` | A field over longitude and pressure, 1000 hPa at the bottom |
| `bars.jsonnet` | Horizontal bars per county from a name coordinate |
| `scatter_xy.jsonnet` | One variable against another, with year labels and a threshold line |
| `verify_grid.jsonnet` | Observation and each lead's forecast on one colorbar, verify hits maps underneath |
| `mediogram.jsonnet` | Forecast members vs model climate as boxes per lead at a point, with the forecast mean |
| `windrose.jsonnet` | Wind observations on polar axes by the direction they blow from, colored by speed |
| `mslp.jsonnet` | Labelled isobars every 4 hPa with H / L and central pressure from local-extrema |

### Arguments
- `-i`, `--input` — `PATH=NAME`, repeat. A Zarr, or a GeoJSON (`.geojson` / `.json`) of outlines. `NAME` is a letter or `_`, then letters, digits and `_` (`OBS`, `fc_week1`); it is how the spec refers to the file. Readable legend text goes in a trace's `"name"`, not here.
- `--spec` — a `.jsonnet` / `.json` file, a recipe name (`map`), or the Jsonnet text itself.
- `--recipe [NAME]` — list the recipes, or print one's Jsonnet; draws nothing.
- `--const NAME=VALUE` — a constant: `'@const.NAME'` in a trace's data (a reference point) or a shape or annotation position that changes from run to run (`--const el_nino=0.5`, a date); `std.extVar('const').NAME` in text, such as a title. Numbers or text; repeat.
- `--dpi N` — pixel density of PNG, JPG and GIF output. The layout is in CSS pixels at 96 dpi (the default); `192` doubles the pixels at the same layout, `300` is print quality. `layout.width` / `height` set the layout itself.
- `-o`, `--output` — `.png`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`, `.svg`, `.html`, or `.gif` (plays the spec's `frames`). Repeat to write several.
- `--dump-spec` — print (`-`) or save (a path) the evaluated spec, `@` strings unresolved, and draw nothing.

## The spec

It is ordinary Jsonnet. Use `local` variables for anything repeated, so long strings (selections, colors) are written once:

```jsonnet
local ws = import 'ws.libsonnet';               // helpers, below
local inputs = std.extVar('inputs');           // what each input holds
local day = '.isel(time=0)';
{
  data: [
    { type: 'heatmap', x: '@OBS.lon', y: '@OBS.lat', z: '@OBS.precip' + day, coloraxis: 'coloraxis' },
  ],
  layout: ws.map(inputs.OBS.bbox) + {
    title: { text: 'Rainfall %s' % inputs.OBS.coords.time[0] },
    coloraxis: ws.stepped(ws.palettes.ppt_day),
  },
}
```

**Changing part of a helper's output.** With `+`, a field you name replaces the helper's field entirely; with `+:` it is merged in. `ws.map(b)` sets `margin: {l: 50, r: 150, t: 70, b: 70}`:

```jsonnet
ws.map(b) + { margin: { l: 110 } }    // margin becomes {l: 110}: r, t, b are lost and the colorbar is cut off
ws.map(b) + { margin+: { l: 110 } }   // margin becomes {l: 110, r: 150, t: 70, b: 70}: only l changes
```

Use `+:` the same way for `xaxis+:`, `coloraxis+:`, and `annotations+:` (which adds to the list instead of replacing it).

**`std.extVar('inputs')`** describes each input, read from its metadata without loading data: `dims` (sizes), `vars` (each one's `dims`, `units`, `long_name`), `coords` (values of 1-D coordinates up to 400 long, and scalar ones: dates as `2026-10-01`, or `2026-10-30T12:00:00` when not midnight; leads as days, `0.125` for 3 h; members, station ids; `valid_time` when the file has it), `attrs`, and `bbox` (`{n, w, s, e}`, from lat / lon coordinates; a grid across the dateline gets `e` past 180, e.g. 150 to 210). Use it for loop bounds, titles and map windows; `ws.date(t)` turns a date into `26 Oct 2026`. A GeoJSON input has `bbox`. To see it all: `--spec "std.extVar('inputs')" --dump-spec -` with your `-i` inputs. Names here are the file's own: a grid on `latitude` / `longitude` has `dims.longitude`, not `dims.lon`; the `lat` / `lon` shorthand works only in `@` references.

### `@` references
A string that starts with `@` is replaced by the data it names; the whole string is the reference, so a reference can't sit inside other text (titles take their dates and names from `inputs`). A string that starts with `@@` is the literal text after the first `@`.

| Form | Gives |
| --- | --- |
| `@OBS.precip`, `@OBS.time`, `@OBS.county` | A variable or coordinate |
| `@OBS.lat`, `@OBS.lon` | The latitude / longitude coordinate, whatever the file calls it |
| `.isel(time=0)`, `.isel(time=-1)`, `.isel(time=slice(0, 7))` | Pick by position (`slice(None, None, 3)`: every 3rd) |
| `.sel(time='2026-10-01')`, `.sel(lat=-1.3, lon=36.8, method='nearest')`, `.sel(station_id=['A', 'B'])` | Pick by value |
| `.dropna('station_id')` | Keep the positions along a dim that have a value (this map's local-extrema centres) |
| `.lon`, `.lat`, `.time`, any coordinate, after a selection | That coordinate of what is left: `@HI.msl.isel(time=0).dropna('station_id').lon` |
| `.squeeze()`, `.transpose('vertical', 'lon')` | Drop size-1 dims, set dim order (pick every other dim first) |
| `.lon360()`, `.lon180()` | A field whose window crosses the edge of its longitudes, drawn in one piece. A file stored as -180 to 180 jumps from 180 back to -180 at the dateline, so a Pacific map (170°E to 170°W) would split into two strips at the sides; `.lon360()` relabels the longitudes 0 to 360 and puts the columns in order. A file stored as 0 to 360 does the same at the prime meridian (Africa from 340 to 40); `.lon180()` relabels them -180 to 180. Use it on the field and on its longitudes: `z: '@X.sst.isel(time=0).lon360()'`, `x: '@X.sst.isel(time=0).lon360().lon'`. `inputs.X.bbox` already gives the unbroken window, and `ws.map` / `ws.grid` label a window past 180° as 170°E, 180°, 170°W |
| `.flat()`, `.flat('lon')`, `.flat('step')` | A 2-D selection as one value per cell, and a dim's coordinate for each value (leads in days): grid cells as scatter points, or every member with its lead for one box per lead |
| `.dt.dayofyear`, `.dt.year`, `.dt.month`, `.dt.day`, `.dt.hour`, `.dt.days`, `.dt.strftime('%d %b')` | Time labels (`.dt.days` of a lead time) |
| `.attrs.units` | A text attribute |
| `… * 2`, `… / 3 + 4`, `… * const.k` | A marker size in pixels: data + − × ÷ a number or `@const`, only on `marker.size`, `marker.standoff`, `marker.line.width`, `textfont.size` (arrows sized by wind speed, dots by rainfall) |
| `.min()`, `.max()`, `.quantile(0.98)` | One number for a scale only: `zmin`, `zmax`, `zmid`, `cmin`, `cmax`, `cmid`, an axis `range`, `tickvals` |
| `@REGION.x`, `@REGION.y` (or `.lon`, `.lat`) | A GeoJSON input's lines and rings, gaps between parts |
| `@REGION.path`, `@NE.ocean_50m.clip(n, w, s, e).path` | Its polygons as an SVG path, for a filled `type: 'path'` shape (holes stay empty) |
| `@NE.coastline_50m.clip(n, w, s, e).x` | Built-in Natural Earth lines: `coastline`, `borders`, `disputed`, `lakes`, `rivers` at `10m` / `50m` / `110m` |
| `@GB.admin1.clip(n, w, s, e).x` | Built-in geoBoundaries admin lines inside each country the box touches, `admin1` or `admin2` (downloaded per country; country outlines are left to `borders` and `coastline`) |

Shapes: `z` is 2-D (a lat/lon grid is drawn with rows as latitudes, and needs `x: '@NAME.lon', y: '@NAME.lat'` beside it); `customdata` 1-D or 2-D; everything else one value or 1-D. A trace's `x` and `y` (not a gridded one's) must pair up: the same length, and from two files the same time (or other) values; otherwise it's an error suggesting `merge`. Traces on one `coloraxis` holding different units print a warning. A dim of length 1 (the one time of a period total) is dropped when there are too many; any other leftover dim is an error naming it: pick a value with `isel` / `sel`, or draw one trace per value with a Jsonnet loop (`for m in std.range(0, inputs.ENS.dims.number - 1)`).

References select and label stored values; they never compute. The one exception, a marker size in pixels (the arithmetic row above), changes how big a marker is on screen, not what is drawn. Arithmetic, averages and smoothing come from data skills first, and the error says which: `summarize-dim` (mean, quantiles over members), `aggregate-temporal` (rolling, resampling), `unit-convert`, `difference`, `coarsen` / `downscale`, `clip-region` (masks), `step-to-time` (valid dates), `wind-speed-direction` (speed and direction from u / v). A mean ± SD band is Plotly stacking: mean − SD from `difference`, then the SD stacked on it twice (`--recipe sd_band`).

### `ws.libsonnet`
`local ws = import 'ws.libsonnet';` gives plain Plotly JSON; change any part with `+`. Imports are found by name in the skill's library (`ws.libsonnet`, `palettes.libsonnet`), its recipes, beside the spec file, and in the working folder, so a palettes file written there (`local mine = import 'my_palettes.libsonnet';`) needs no flag.

- `ws.map(box, width=760, pad=0.03, sea='#c9d1d8')` — one map's axes (equal degrees, range from `box` widened by `pad`), a canvas sized to it, the legend in a row under the map, and the sea filled under the data, so it shows wherever a field has no data (the sea under a land-only field); land stays white. `sea` sets its color (`sea='#708090'` matches the lakes), `sea=null` leaves it out. It is a layout shape named `basemap-sea-0`, kept alongside your own shapes in either order.
- `ws.pad(bbox, frac=0.03)` — `bbox` widened on every side by `frac` of its larger span. `inputs.NAME.bbox` runs between the outermost cell centres, so `ws.map`, `ws.grid` and `ws.basemap` pad it by 3% so edge cells and outlines aren't cut; `pad=0` keeps the box exact.
- `ws.grid(box, rows, cols, panel=340, gap=0.04, pad=0.03, empty=[], sea='#c9d1d8')` — axes for maps in a grid, filled row by row. `empty` lists panels with no map: they are hidden, and tick labels go on the lowest filled panel of each column and the leftmost of each row. Panels showing different regions: set `xaxisN+: {range: […], showticklabels: true}` (and `yaxisN+:`) from `ws.pad(their bbox)`. `ws.rowTitle(i, text)` labels the row that starts at panel `i`. `ws.axes(i)` gives panel `i`'s `xaxis` / `yaxis` (`x`, `x2`, …) to add to a trace; `ws.panelTitle(i, text)` an annotation above it (add titles with `annotations+:` after `ws.classBar`). `ws.axes` and `ws.panelTitle` work for chart panels too; lay those out with Plotly's own `layout.grid: {rows, columns, pattern: 'independent'}`.
- `ws.basemap(box, i=0, coastline=true, borders=true, disputed=true, lakes=true, rivers=true, admin='auto', style={}, pad=0.03, view=null)` — base-map lines on panel `i`, clipped to the same padded box as `ws.map` / `ws.grid`. `admin` takes a level, not `true`: `1` states / provinces / counties, `2` the units below them, `false` none, or `'auto'` (the default: `1` on maps up to 20° across, else none). Its lines come from geoBoundaries, the same units as `resolve-region`, `clip-region` and `label-group`. The other layers are on unless switched off with `false`: `rivers`, `lakes` (always drawn opaque over the data unless `lakes=false`), `borders` (agreed international boundaries), `disputed` (every other land line, dashed) and `coastline`. Layers are drawn bottom first: `admin`, `rivers`, `lakes`, `borders`, `disputed`, `coastline`. Admin lines are only those between a country's units; its outline is the `borders` and `coastline` layers'. Each country in the box is one download, and offline the admin lines are skipped with a warning. "No disputed borders" is `ws.basemap(bbox, disputed=false)`; fewer lines on small panels, `rivers=false, admin=false`. `style={admin: {line: {color: 'white'}}}` restyles a layer by the same names. The sea is filled by `ws.map` / `ws.grid` (below); land is not. A GeoJSON input draws boundaries of your own. `view='KEN'` (any ISO3 code) draws that country's border its own way: the outline `resolve-region` writes (geoBoundaries), with Natural Earth's `borders` and `disputed` lines on or inside it left out, so Kenya includes the Ilemi Triangle; other countries keep Natural Earth's lines. Country borders come from `borders`; outline only regions it doesn't draw (one county picked out, your own polygon). A country's outline from `resolve-region` doesn't line up with Natural Earth's 10 m borders, so drawing it as well doubles the border.
- `ws.classBar(p, title='', coloraxis='coloraxis', x=1.03, y=0.05, len=0.85, width=0.03, format='%g')` — for a class palette: the `coloraxis` with color steps at the class bounds, and a colorbar with one equal-height band per class, labelled at the bounds with `format`, a Jsonnet `%` code such as `'%g'` or `'%d%%'` (or by the palette's `labels`, which can name the triangles too), under / over as triangles. It is drawn as layout shapes and annotations, so write your own as `annotations+: [...]` after it. `y` (the bottom of the bands) and `len` place it, as fractions of the plotting area, when a figure has two: e.g. `y=0.55, len=0.4` and `y=0.05, len=0.4`; leave room for the under / over triangles and the title between them. Keep `title` short (`mm`, `m/s`): it sits above the bar. A second `ws.classBar` for the same `coloraxis` replaces the first, so `layout+: ws.classBar(other palette)` swaps a recipe's palette; bars for other axes and your own shapes and annotations stay.
- `ws.stepped(p)` — the coloraxis object itself, with Plotly's own colorbar: `coloraxis: ws.stepped(p)` (or `coloraxis2:`). Use it for continuous palettes (no `bounds`), with `cmin` / `cmax` / `cmid` added by `+`.
- `ws.palettes.NAME` — `{colors, bounds}`: rainfall totals `ppt_day` (0–50 mm), `ppt_week` (0–200, also a dekad), `ppt_month` (0–400), `ppt_season` (0–1000), `ppt_total` (0–2500); anomalies `ppt_anom_day` … `ppt_anom_season` (±50 / ±200 / ±300 / ±500); `ppt_poa` (% of normal), `spi`, the masters they are cut from `ppt_master`, `ppt_anom_master`; `ppt_spp`; verify maps `hits` (classes with labels); continuous (no bounds, for `ws.stepped`): `bias`, `precip_bias`, `mae`, `wind_rose`, `colorblind`, `rocket`; Tropical Tidbits model charts `tt_precip_rate` (mm/h), `tt_precip_total`, `tt_pwat` (mm), `tt_wind` (m/s), `tt_z500` (dam). Your own: `{colors: [...], bounds: [...]}`, one color per class, or under + classes + over; `labels: [...]` names the classes: one per class, or with under / over colors one per color, the first and last labelling the triangles (`['<1', '1–10', …, '>100']`).
- `ws.date(t, year=true)` — `'2026-10-26'` → `26 Oct 2026`; a time not at midnight adds `12 UTC`.
- `ws.dayOfYearTicks` — `xaxis` ticks at the 1st of each month for a `.dt.dayofyear` axis (counted in a non-leap year; after 28 Feb a leap year sits a day later).
- `ws.player(names, duration=500)` — play / pause buttons and a slider for frames named `names`; a `.gif` plays at the same `duration` (ms).
- `ws.template` — the house colorway (no grey, kept for ensemble members) on a white plot area. A spec that sets no `layout.template` gets it; extend it with `template: ws.template + {layout+: {...}}`, set a Plotly template by name (`template: 'plotly_white'`), or `template: {}` for Plotly's bare defaults.

## Notes
- Shapes and annotations at a fixed position on a data axis take the position as typed (an annotation on a log axis takes its log10; see below): a line at Lake Turkana (`xref: 'x', x0: 36, x1: 36, yref: 'paper', y0: 0, y1: 1`), a threshold band (`y0: 0.5, y1: 1`), an annotation at a date. For a position that changes each run (an init date in a scheduled job), pass it with `--const init=2026-10-31` and write `x0: '@const.init'`. A scatter trace with no `@` references at all is a mark placed by hand and may type in up to 5 values per data key: a cross-section line (`x: [33, 42], y: [3.5, 3.5]`), a town pin, a reference arrow, the flat edge a fill reaches down to. Any other trace type (heatmap, contour, bar, pie, …) shows values, so it always binds them: a table of scores is one Zarr bound with `@`, never cells typed into the spec. A trace that draws data binds all of its data; a constant there is `--const`, as `x: ['@const.kx']`. Marks can't go in frames. A key, legend box or label that need not sit at a lon / lat goes in `xref: 'paper'` / `yref: 'paper'` units. Labelled bars keep their data axis: `x: '@A.time'` with `xaxis: {tickvals: '@A.time', ticktext: [...]}`, not `x: ['28 Sep–4 Oct', …]`.
- A season across New Year (Oct–Feb) on one axis: `x: '@Y.time.dt.strftime("%d %b")'` with `xaxis: {type: 'category', categoryorder: 'array', categoryarray: '@LEAP.time.dt.strftime("%d %b")'}`, the order taken from one input that covers the season in a leap year.
- A second y axis (`overlaying: 'y'`) syncs its ticks to the first by default; set `tickmode: 'auto'` on it for round numbers.
- The base map downloads Natural Earth shapefiles on first use (cartopy, network needed); later runs reuse them.
- Titles don't wrap: break a long one with `<br>`, or put the detail in `title.subtitle`.
- A log axis (pressure) labels Plotly's minor ticks too; set `tickvals` to the levels (`tickvals: '@RH.vertical'`).
- On a log axis, an annotation's `x` / `y` and the axis `range` are the log10 of the value: a label at 850 hPa is `y: 2.93` (`std.log(850) / std.log(10)`), and 1000 to 200 hPa is `range: [3, 2.30103]`. Shapes and traces take the value itself (`y0: 1000`). An annotation at `y: 850` sits at 10^850, and autorange stretches the axis to reach it, squeezing the data into a sliver. A label that need not sit at a level goes in `yref: 'paper'`.
- Values are drawn in the file's own units (K stays K, Pa stays Pa): run unit-convert for °C or hPa, and set palette bounds and contour levels in those units.
- A forecast's `step` is a lead time. Run step-to-time to draw it by valid date beside observations, or use `.dt.days` for lead days.
- Animations: `frames[k].data` replaces the traces listed in `frames[k].traces` (by position in `data`). Keep the base map out of the frames: it stays on every frame. A scatter trace in the frames must be `scattergl`: an SVG `scatter` there blanks the heatmap on every other paint, so the map flashes. `wind_markers` arrows don't animate well: `scattergl` has no `marker.standoff`, so their heads would sit mid-shaft.
- A still image takes at most 100 panels; play more as frames.
- Errors come from Jsonnet (syntax, unknown field), from the reference checks (which data, which dim, which skill), or from Plotly itself, naming the trace and its type (`data[3].line: a heatmap has no property 'line'`), with what to do for the usual mix-ups.

## Output
The figure at each `-o`. Every output prints `plot hash:` (of the pixels for PNG / JPG / GIF, of the figure JSON for PDF / SVG / HTML) and `data: not null | NULL` over the plotted traces, frames included; a trace that is all NaN gets its own line. A GIF also prints its frame count and size, with a warning above 8 MB, which many chat clients and slide tools won't show inline; an animated HTML prints its frame count and figure size, with a warning above 50 MB. The provenance (`weather_skills_history`, with the evaluated spec) is embedded in the file; read it with the provenance skill. A PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG or PDF whose history is complete carries a small red seal in its bottom-right corner.
